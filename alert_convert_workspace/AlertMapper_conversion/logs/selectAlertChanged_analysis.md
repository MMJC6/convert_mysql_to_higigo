# Preprocessing Analysis - selectAlertChanged.sql

## File Information
- Priority: high
- Line Count: 1
- Source: AlertMapper.xml
- Functions to Convert: None

## Value Conversions Needed
1. Backticks
   ```sql
   Before: SELECT `value`
   After:  SELECT value
   ```
   - Remove backticks around 'value' column

2. Aliases
   - No aliases present
   - No explicit AS needed

## Structure Changes
- No multi-table UPDATEs present
- No HAVING conditions present
- No REPLACE INTO statements present
- No ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clauses present
- Simple SELECT query with straightforward conversion needs

## XML Considerations
- Preserve XML entities in mapper file
- Maintain original formatting and indentation
- No CDATA sections present in this query

## Test Cases Needed
1. Basic Query Test
   ```sql
   SELECT value
   FROM tbl_sequence
   WHERE sequence_name = 'alert_rule_change';
   ```

2. Test with Sample Data
   ```sql
   -- Insert test data
   INSERT INTO tbl_sequence (sequence_name, value) 
   VALUES ('alert_rule_change', '123');
   
   -- Run query
   SELECT value
   FROM tbl_sequence
   WHERE sequence_name = 'alert_rule_change';
   
   -- Cleanup
   DELETE FROM tbl_sequence 
   WHERE sequence_name = 'alert_rule_change';
   ```

## Validation Requirements
1. Value Handling
   - Verify backtick removal works correctly
   - Check column access without backticks

2. XML Structure
   - Ensure XML mapper structure remains valid
   - Verify no unintended changes to surrounding XML
